          Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) was a German philosopher and cultural
          critic who published intensively in the 1870s and 1880s. He is famous
          for uncompromising criticisms of traditional European morality and
          religion, as well as of conventional philosophical ideas and social
          and political pieties associated with modernity. Many of these
          criticisms rely on psychological diagnoses that expose false
          consciousness infecting people’s received ideas; for that reason, he
          is often associated with a group of late modern thinkers (including
          Marx and Freud) who advanced a “hermeneutics of suspicion” against
          traditional values (see Foucault [1964] 1990, Ricoeur [1965] 1970,
          Leiter 2004). Nietzsche also used his psychological analyses to
          support original theories about the nature of the self and provocative
          proposals suggesting new values that he thought would promote cultural
          renewal and improve social and psychological life by comparison to
          life under the traditional values he criticized.
